We are planning to have a website that contains many recipes that the user can access. The users will be access the recipe information through MongoDB and will also be able to contribute their own recipe if they like to be placed on the website aswell. There also will be a searchbar to allow for easy finding of specific recipes based on the recipe name or details. We would also love a comment section and a star rating on each recipe for opinions for the users. We currently do not have enough people, so we cannot determine which member will get which task.

Features/Endpoints:
Navbar on main page
Browse All Recipes
Filter Recipes by Tags
Enter New Recipe>Edit Recipe>Delete Recipe
